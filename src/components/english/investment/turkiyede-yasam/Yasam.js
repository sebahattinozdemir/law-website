Before the research, you must determine the criteria you will search for in a home. Do not forget that the location and age of the house you are going to live in are important factors that determine the rental price. When you rent a house through a real estate agent, you must pay the consultant a service fee. The service fee is collected as 10% + VAT (18%) of the one-year rental fee, for once from the tenant, regardless of the contract term. If you rent your house directly from the property owner as a result of internet or street searches, you do not need to pay any fees. </p>
